# colour spaces and colour theory

how does rgb work?

our eyes have three main receptors
1 for longer wavelengths (red)
1 for shorter wavelengths (green)
1 for shorter wagvelengths (blue)

computers uses RGB lights in the same fashion, they illuminate the colours accordingly

other animals have different cones in their eyes (they can't see red)
certain insects have 12 receptors

RGB is additive, they add on -> makes brighter colours
subtractive colours become darker 

complementary colours - colours that are opposite on the colour wheel

santa and christmas tree (red and green)
fanta sign (blue and orange)
lotus (yellow and purple)


-----

screen made up of pixels -> made up of small lights -> RGB
resolution to measure how many pixels are on a screen
density -> more pixels in the same amount of space

images carry data of missions of tuples of RGB values

why is RGB up to 255
RGB is made up of 8 bits -> 11111111 in base 2 -> 255 in base 10

to change the colours in a photo, you can map certain functions to change the RGB to different RGB values
