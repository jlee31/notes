# Colour Spaces and Colour Theory

## How Does RGB Work?

- Our eyes have **three main receptors (cones):**
  1. One for longer wavelengths (**red**)
  2. One for medium wavelengths (**green**)
  3. One for shorter wavelengths (**blue**)

- Computers use **RGB lights** in the same fashion, illuminating these colours accordingly.

- Other animals have different cones in their eyes (some can't see red).  
  For example, certain insects have **12 receptors**!

- **RGB is additive:**  
  Adding red, green, and blue lights creates **brighter colours**.

- **Subtractive colours** (like inks and paints) work oppositely:  
  They mix to create **darker colours** by absorbing light.

## Complementary Colours

- Colours that are opposite each other on the colour wheel.

**Examples:**
- Santa and Christmas tree → **Red and Green**  
- Fanta sign → **Blue and Orange**  
- Lotus flower → **Yellow and Purple**

## Screens and Pixels

- Screens are made up of **pixels**, each containing small RGB lights.  
- **Resolution:** Number of pixels on a screen.  
- **Pixel density:** More pixels in the same amount of physical space = sharper images.

- Images store data as **tuples of RGB values**.

## Why is RGB up to 255?

- Each RGB channel uses **8 bits**.  
- Binary `11111111` = **255** in decimal.  
- So, each channel ranges from 0 to 255.

## Changing Colours in Photos

- To alter colours, you can apply **functions to map RGB values** to new RGB values.
