An issue that I encountered today was failing to git pull from my remote linux school server.

The error I had was 
`Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-with-mic,keyboard-interactive). fatal: Could not read from remote repository. Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists.`

The error happeneed cuz git remote was pointing to linux, but it was suppose to authenticate with the new ubuntu server 24.04 machine. 

Process:
git pull > ssh linux... > no matching SSH config > no key offered > permission denied

Solution:
```
git remote set-url origin [correct link]
```
