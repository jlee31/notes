### Computer Architecture (Disk Storage, RAM, Cache, CPU)

- bits (0 or 1)
- bytes (8 bits) > megabyte > gigabite > terabyte
- computer storage is either HDD or SSD
- harddrive also holds the operating systems
- RAM - random access memory - primary active memory - requires power and will be lost if you restart the computer
- cache memory: extremely fast memory
- goes from CPU checks L1 then L2 then L3 cache then RAM (reduces average time to access data)
- CPU - control processing units - controls processing
- GPU - graphics processsing units - controls graphics
- motherboard - component that connects everything (creates pathways)
- compilers convert code into machine code that be executed by the cpu

### Production App Architecture (CI/CD, Load Balancers, Logging & Monitoring)

- CI/CD - enures code from repo to production through tests without any manual interventions (Jenkins or github actions)
- Load Balancer and reverse proxies evenly distribute traffic between servers
- Data is stored with external storage servers on a different server connected by a different network 

### Design Requirements (CAP Theorem, Throughput, Latency, SLOs and SLAs)

### Networking (TCP, UDP, DNS, IP Addresses & IP Headers)

### Application Layer Protocols (HTTP, WebSockets, WebRTC, MQTT, etc)

### API Design

### Caching and CDNs

### Proxy Servers (Forward/Reverse Proxies)

### Load Balancers

### Databases (Sharding, Replication, ACID, Vertical & Horizontal Scaling)
