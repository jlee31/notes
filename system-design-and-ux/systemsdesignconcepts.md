### Computer Architecture (Disk Storage, RAM, Cache, CPU)

- bits (0 or 1)
- bytes (8 bits) > megabyte > gigabite > terabyte
- computer storage is either HDD or SSD
- harddrive also holds the operating systems
- RAM - random access memory - primary active memory - requires power and will be lost if you restart the computer
- cache memory: extremely fast memory
- goes from CPU checks L1 then L2 then L3 cache then RAM (reduces average time to access data)
- CPU - control processing units - controls processing
- GPU - graphics processsing units - controls graphics
- motherboard - component that connects everything (creates pathways)
- compilers convert code into machine code that be executed by the cpu

### Production App Architecture (CI/CD, Load Balancers, Logging & Monitoring)

- CI/CD - enures code from repo to production through tests without any manual interventions (Jenkins or github actions)
- Load Balancer and reverse proxies evenly distribute traffic between servers
- Data is stored with external storage servers on a different server connected by a different network 

### Design Requirements (CAP Theorem, Throughput, Latency, SLOs and SLAs)

### Networking (TCP, UDP, DNS, IP Addresses & IP Headers)

### Application Layer Protocols (HTTP, WebSockets, WebRTC, MQTT, etc)

### API Design

### Caching and CDNs

### Proxy Servers (Forward/Reverse Proxies)

### Load Balancers

### Databases (Sharding, Replication, ACID, Vertical & Horizontal Scaling)

# Carhartt Jacket Comparison: J140 vs Sherpa-Lined Utility (103826)

| Feature | J140 (Level 3 “Warmest”) | Sherpa-Lined Utility (103826) (Level 2 “Warmer”) |
|--------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Warmth Rating | Level 3 — “Engineered for high warmth in severely cold conditions” :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10} | Level 2 — “Engineered for mid-range warmth in moderately cold conditions” :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11} |
| Canadian user feedback | Users in Canada say it keeps them warm in very cold / frozen conditions. E.g., “my favourite winter jacket here in Canada when it’s frozen outside.” :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12} | Users say it’s good for winter, but less “ultimate cold” than Level 3; e.g., “least warm of your 3 options.” :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13} |
| Shell + insulation | 12-oz firm ring-spun cotton duck; flannel-lined body & hood; quilted nylon sleeves. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14} | 12-oz washed ring-spun cotton duck; sherpa fleece in body & hood; quilted nylon sleeves. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15} |
| Suitability for –10 °C + snow in Canada | Strong. Good margin. Better suited for wind, longer exposure, less layering required (but still helps). | Decent. Will work with layering and when exposure is moderate. Less margin for heavy wind, long exposure, wet snow. |
| Potential downsides | Bulkiness; flannel lining may pill; heavier; may restrict mobility; not fully waterproof. | Less “extreme” warmth; may require layering; shell is cotton duck (not fully waterproof); less margin for harsh exposure. |
| Best usage scenario | Cold Canadian winters, snow, wind, longer time outside; when you want comfort without constant layering. | Typical winter days, moderate exposure, layering underneath, mostly moving around rather than standing still in heavy wind/snow. |
