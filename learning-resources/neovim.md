-----------------------------------------------------------
stages of neovim
1) awareness / noticing
2) coping - notice the steep curve of neovim/vim
3) skill issues - you are quite bad at neovim - slowly you get better
4) setup neovim config - lazyvim, astro, nvchad
5) best neovim config - the one that you create that works for you (i mean obviously...)

alias vim='nvim' -> use neovim alias

-----------------------------------------------------------

1) start with ide and learn vim motions
2) use a preconfigured neovim distribution if you are good at using neovim first
3) stating off: use kickstarter.vim (A launch point for your personal vim configuration)
4) sufficient motivation is what you truly need to get anything

why not just use vscode?: getting closer to understanding how your environment works will just expand your mind 

1) learn basics with vscode + vim addition
2) use vanilla neovim
3) build own setup with neovim and plugins
4) try lazyvim -> even the default configuration is pretty good

-------------------------------------------------------

### What is Kickstart

- it is not a distribution
- kickstart is a starting point for your own neovim configuration
- you should know some lua before doing neovim
