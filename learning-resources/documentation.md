- the more time you spend in the documentation, the better of a developer that you will be
- search up keywords
- the better you get reading different documentation, the easier it is to find the things you want

steps:
1) identify the data type / structure you are working with
2) identify the goal you have and align it with a particular function
3) search the docs to see what you are looking for in this case

- the point of the documentation is to give you what the code looks like for you to use

Notes of Said Posts:

- an important thing about the docs is that you get your own searching feature in your brain when looking up things, you have to read the docs for a while so you know when ai is feeding you slop or not
- documentation > google > ai
- docs for learning, ai for fixing syntax??, maybe not for fixing issues though
- AI can help augment productivity, but shouldn’t completely replace your critical thinking in designing and developing software.
- If you could not do it yourself, dont ask AI to do it for you, but maybe ask AI where to find the information to fix the problem instead?
"Hey, am struggling with building a makefile, could you give me 5 sources where to learn the correct syntax? Alao, what are some of the best books about it? Whats the most common error people have while trying to make their own?"
Stuff like that, AI can still save you time without giving you the answer and stealing the learning opportunities.
