- the more time you spend in the documentation, the better of a developer that you will be
- search up keywords
- the better you get reading different documentation, the easier it is to find the things you want

steps:
1) identify the data type / structure you are working with
2) identify the goal you have and align it with a particular function
3) search the docs to see what you are looking for in this case

- the point of the documentation is to give you what the code looks like for you to use
