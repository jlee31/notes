- the more time you spend in the documentation, the better of a developer that you will be
- search up keywords
- the better you get reading different documentation, the easier it is to find the things you want

steps:
1) identify the data type / structure you are working with
2) identify the goal you have and align it with a particular function
3) search the docs to see what you are looking for in this case

- the point of the documentation is to give you what the code looks like for you to use

Notes of Said Posts:

- an important thing about the docs is that you get your own searching feature in your brain when looking up things, you have to read the docs for a while so you know when ai is feeding you slop or not
- documentation > google > ai
- docs for learning, ai for fixing syntax??, maybe not for fixing issues though
- AI can help augment productivity, but shouldn’t completely replace your critical thinking in designing and developing software.
- If you could not do it yourself, dont ask AI to do it for you, but maybe ask AI where to find the information to fix the problem instead?
"Hey, am struggling with building a makefile, could you give me 5 sources where to learn the correct syntax? Alao, what are some of the best books about it? Whats the most common error people have while trying to make their own?"
Stuff like that, AI can still save you time without giving you the answer and stealing the learning opportunities.


Yeah, this is super common and honestly you're already aware of it which is half the battle. Here's what actually works: set hard rules for yourself, like no AI for the first 30 minutes of being stuck, then you can use it to check your approach or get a hint rather than the full solution. The key difference is asking "why doesn't this work" instead of "write this for me".

Also try coding in an environment where you can't easily access AI, like offline or on your phone without it nearby. Sounds silly but friction helps a lot at 16 when willpower is still developing.

The frustration you're feeling when coding without AI is actually a good sign, that's where learning happens. Push through it for like 10 minutes before you even think about asking for help. You'll be surprised how often you figure it out.

One more thing: use AI to explain concepts or debug your own code after you've attempted it, not to write it from scratch. There's a huge difference between "why is my loop not working" and "write me a loop". The first teaches you, the second doesn't.

You're already thinking about this at 16 which puts you ahead of a lot of people who just coast. Stick with it and the dependency will fade once you realize you actually can solve these things yourself.
