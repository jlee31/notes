# notes

### compiling

``` c++

g++ -std::c++14 program.cc -o program

```

### vectors in c++

- in the stl library, they don't let you change the main functions to keep the data structure integrity

- custom objects should have the features in order to work with the stls effortlessly
- You can overload <, >, <=, >=, !=, etc
