// while we have arrays, adding and deleting items in a linked list is quite memory intensive
// arrays you have to declare space for , that you might not use
// one ADT like a Liinked List is created one at a time, but you have to track links in pointers (but it can get messy)
//

// STL - Standard Template Library
// it is a generic collection of lcass templates, algorithms and iterators that allow you to easily make queues, lists and stacks
// uses containers and container adapters

// the stl library don't give you many options to manipulate the functions
