- honestly this video was pretty useless lmao

- timeless programming - how do we build software - focus on real-world trade-offs, doing what makes sense, avoid overengineering and staying adaptable
- continuous learning & skill invesment - never stay stuck with one technology
- write code deliberately, avoid accidental coplexity
- use automation, tests and good practices to safeguard quality
- iterate, prototype and adapt
